Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Roles

| Role | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `ADMIN` | `/api/admin/**` |
| `STUDENT` | `/api/student/**` |
| `LECTURER` | `/api/lecturer/**` |
| `ACADEMIC_ADVISOR` | `/api/advisor/**` |

## Common Error Shape

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-15T08:00:00Z",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "path": "/api/admin/students",
  "fieldErrors": {
    "email": "Email is invalid"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `400`: validation error or business rule error.
- `401`: missing or invalid token.
- `403`: token is valid but role is not allowed, or account is inactive.
- `404`: endpoint not found.
- Many business errors are currently returned as `400` with `message`.

## Important ID Notes

- `AccountResponse.id` is the `users.id`.
- `AccountResponse.profileId` is the profile id, for example `students.id`, `lecturers.id`, or `academic_advisors.id`.
- `CourseSectionRequest.lecturerId` expects the lecturer profile id, not the user id.
- Advisor assignment uses advisor profile id and student profile id.

- `PAID`, `WAIVED`, or missing tuition record allow course registration.
- Course registration uses Redis lock per course section. Redis must be running for `POST /api/student/registrations`.

  "note": "Paid by bank transfer"
}
```

## Frontend Testing Checklist

1. Login with each role and save its token.
2. Use `roles` from login response to route the user to the correct screen.
3. Use `/api/student/course-sections/open` for the student registration catalog.
4. Use `availableSeats` and `schedules` from `CourseSectionResponse` on registration screens.
5. Use profile ids from account responses when creating course sections or advisor assignments.
6. Expect `403` when using the wrong role token.
7. Expect `400` with `fieldErrors` for invalid request bodies.
